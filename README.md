### About the Experiment 

Hamming code is a powerful error-detection and correction method used in digital communication and computer networks. It ensures data integrity by detecting and correcting single-bit errors.
Experiment Overview
The study of single-bit error detection and correction using Hamming code involves encoding data with redundant bits, transmitting it, and then checking for errors at the receiver's end.
Steps in the Experiment
- Encoding the Data:
- The sender adds redundant bits to the original data.
- These bits are placed at positions that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
- The values of these bits are calculated using parity checks.
- Transmission:
- The encoded data is sent over a communication channel.
- Noise or interference may cause a single-bit error.
- Error Detection:
- The receiver recalculates the parity bits.
- If an error is detected, the position of the erroneous bit is determined.
- Error Correction:
- The incorrect bit is flipped to restore the original data.
- The corrected data is then used for further processing.
Key Concepts
- Parity Bits: Used to detect errors.
- Redundant Bits: Extra bits added for error correction.
- Binary Representation: Helps in identifying erroneous bits.
